            <p class = Chorus1>It's a beautiful night, we're looking for something dumb to do<br>
            Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you<br>
            Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?<br>
            Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you</p>


            <p>Well, I know this little chapel on the boulevard, we can go<br>
            No one will know, oh, come on, girl<br>
            Who cares if we're trashed? Got a pocket full of cash we can blow<br>
            Shots of Patrón and it's on, girl</p>


            <p>Don't say no, no, no, no, no<br>
            Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            And we'll go, go, go, go, go<br>
            If you're ready, like I'm ready</p>


            <p>'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're looking for something dumb to do<br>
            Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you<br>
            Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?<br>
            Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you<br>
            Oh</p>


            <p class = Chorus2>I'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing like, "Ooh"<br>
            So what you wanna do? Let's just run, girl<br>
            If we wake up and you wanna break up, that's cool<br>
            No, I won't blame you, it was fun, girl</p>


            <p>Don't say no, no, no, no, no<br>
            Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            And we'll go, go, go, go, go<br>
            If you're ready, like I'm ready</p>


            <p>'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're looking for something dumb to do<br>
            Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you<br>
            Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?<br>
            Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you</p>

            <p>Just say, "I do"<br>
            Tell me right now, baby, tell me right now, baby, baby<br>
            Just say, "I do"<br>
            Tell me right now, baby, tell me right now, baby, baby, oh</p>


            <p class = Chorus3>It's a beautiful night, we're looking for something dumb to do<br>
            Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you<br>
            Is it that look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?<br>
            Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you</p>
